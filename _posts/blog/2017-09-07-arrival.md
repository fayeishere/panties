We set out from Sacramento at a reasonable hour in the morning. All in all, a pretty boring drive to Phoenix. We stay with an alum of the organization we’ll be volunteering for. She and my friend worked together before during the Katrina relief. I don’t really sleep since I’m still on a late schedule and the further east we go the harder it is. We roll out at 4am to get to San Antonio, a 17 hour drive) by a reasonable hour. Texas is a hard state to drive through, with confusing signage and not much to look at. We get a hotel and appreciate one last night before Houston.

We arrive at “base” just outside of Houston where we are greeted by a staff member of the organization. We are given a tour of the mostly empty space as most volunteers are out on the field working. The rules are gone over: no getting wasted, no alcohol on base, and no hooking up with the staff members. They ask us how long we plan to be there and we both shrug. I decide to commit to a month, but leave it open ended. The space is in a church and the sleep area is set up behind curtains in the main church congregation room, flanking the stage. We find a little hidden spot and start setting up camp. My friend brought a double inflatable bed that looks quite luxurious next to my camping pad. Overall, I’m just happy to be out of the car. It will be hours before everyone gets back to base for dinner, so we decide to cruise around the neighborhood to get our bearings.

It doesn’t take long to realize we are very much in suburbia. Gated communities and strip malls surround us. And no sign that there had been a hurricane. I guess I wouldn’t be needing my waders today. We get back to base and eat with about 40 volunteers that have been trickling in within the week. We chat with some folks and head towards the nightly mandatory meeting. The meetings seem fairly organized: we are introduced and hear about everyone’s day, and what is in store for everyone tomorrow. There is a big board that lists different houses and names are distributed throughout to make sure each house gets enough workers. Lights out is at 10pm and curfew is at 11pm. I sleep a little bit.

Lights on at 7am but people are up getting ready before that. We have just enough time to get dressed, freshen up, eat a snack bar, prepare a PB&J sandwich for lunch, and fill up my mug of coffee. At 7:45am we are out looking for our team leads to get us into the van and head out. I’m asking a million questions to anybody and everybody trying to prepare myself. I’m wearing clothes that I don’t mind pitching at the end of this, as mucking out houses tends to annihilate clothing. Our first stop in the van is the tool shed where we load up and grab a coffee from a shop next door. The coffee shop owner was nice enough to let the organization store tools in part of her building since the church wasn’t equipped to store things on such a scale securely. Finally, we are back on the road and headed to our house that we will be mucking and gutting. As we drive down the block, the streets are clear but the sidewalks are lined with tossed belongings from each house. We pull up to the house. The owner is elderly and not living there so we struggle through the keylock and alarm system to get in. A crew had worked some the day before so a bit of progress had already been made. But, a lot more work needed to be done.

Some of the rooms were still full of belongings and everything that touched water had to be tossed. Papers, lamps, chairs, cabinets. Everything. The rest of everything had to be bagged and put aside for the homeowner to go through. Once everything had been separated on the curb. Hazards, furniture, and garbage we got to work gutting. Pulling baseboard out, trim, doors including jams, and floorboards. The end of the day arrived before we knew it. We got back to base around 5:30pm and grabbed our shower gear (there were no showers at base) and headed to a nearby club that agreed to let us use their facilities. There were only two showers so I got in and got out as quickly as possible. Piled back into the car and made it back to base in time for dinner. After dinner was our meeting that staff informed us that we’d all be moving bases. I was not too thrilled after being in the car for 4 days I wanted someplace to hang my hat for awhile. But two nights it would be! We packed up what we could and were instructed to put our things in a pile and they’d be transported for us (while we worked the next day) to our new base. Lots of grumbles. It’s the first week for this base to be setup and configuration is a headache to say the least. Just enough time to pack and then off to sleep again. Meanwhile half the base is off at the bar and stumble back home past curfew. I can tell that I’m getting old at this point. I find my earplugs and get back to sleep.
