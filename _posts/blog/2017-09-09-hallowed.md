I awake at 6 am to someone who thought that it would be better to pack up in the morning. I find my eye mask quickly. I was scheduled with an unusual task for the day to hang out with a guy from the Cajun Navy to give away cups for donations. I didn’t know much about the organization that I was working with, so I was a bit nervous to be “selling” it to strangers.

The day turned out to be far more rewarding than expected. This guy from the Cajun Navy was a big mover and shaker in the community. He brought out the people in droves with just a few facebook posts. We hadn’t even set up the booth completely and there was a line of folks in the parking lot wanting their cups. Things went along pretty smoothly once we got a system down. Members of the community would roll up in their big trucks in the parking lot. Some would just get their cups, but many would hang out and chat. At times there were ten people all exchanging stories of their houses and neighborhoods. It felt like what I imagined a church social to feel like. Almost everyone knew each other. Some folks dropped off items for donation and some would grab items out of the Cajun Navy guy’s truck. It was a convenient bartering station for everyone.

My volunteer partner for the day had spent most of the time haggling for more cups at Walmart, but rallied with me by the end. At around 2pm we decided to pack up, and reached out to base for a pickup. Overall, the day was full of hugs and blessings all around. I really enjoyed getting to know the community who welcomed me with open arms. We made about $4,000 in donations which was mind blowing. After a day in the sun and lots of people I felt exhausted but really good.

After about 45 minutes my partner and I realize we may have been forgotten and we check back in. They had forgotten us, but luckily Cajun Navy guy decided to swing back by to check on us. I was thankful he did as we climbed in for a ride. He cruises us through the neighborhood, which is full of huge fancy houses. He tells us about the damage done, in between blowing on a DUI breathalyzer. Here’s something I really appreciate about Texans - at least the community I had met today. Some were super well off, dropping hundreds to the cause, and talking about how bad the neighboring community got hit. Their church groups make lunches for their schools. There’s no sense of shame for grabbing a bottle of bleach, and there’s no pretensions or “airs” about helping people. Everyone is treated with the same respect, and no one is perfect. Our hero of the day included.

We arrive back at our “old base” which was now a coordination or logistics headquarters. We’d still be eating and meeting there for two more evenings. We got back a little early and there was a huge community event going on at the church. Did I mention we were in God country? I decided to head out across the street to an eatery and work on some client work I still needed to do. About a half hour later I get a call to come back as we’re going back to the other base. I hustle back and we arrive at the "new base" only to find everyone’s things had been in a disarray. No one could find their stuff, and things were spread out between 5 rooms. Everyone is exhausted, confused, and some of us are pissed. Eventually, we sort things out enough and head back to the other base for dinner and the daily meeting.

Our meeting got a little wild and ended up lasting 2 1/2 hours. It was packed with anger, sadness, passion, and argument. People were pissed that some of the houses we were working on were rich people’s houses. Others defended the decisions, and some people talked over each other. Everyone who was holding back let loose. One of the directors addressed everyone’s concerns in a really heartfelt way and helped to steer the ship back. The meeting ended with transparency, apologies, and gratitude for feedback. The mood was elevated and people felt like we were headed back on track. Energy was super high afterwards and everyone got to base late and still buzzing - most folks were up way past curfew just processing what had happened. It felt like some dysfunctional family that finally hit a turning point and we all were back together.
