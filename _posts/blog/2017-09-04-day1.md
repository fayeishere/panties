My interest in natural disasters started at a fairly early age, though I've been lucky enough not to endure one yet. Growing up in California, there was always the chatter about earthquakes, and at one point I had hoped to get into emergency management. Over the years that dream faded, and though I have quite a bit of survival gear - the closest I've come to "surviving" anything was watching Naked and Afraid on TV. I was raised by a veteran marine cop dad and an ex-hippy independent mom. They taught me to be prepared for anything and to depend on myself. Being raised by divorced parents meant sometimes conflicting advice, but I've learned over the years to mesh their voices together - and sometimes disregard their words entirely. When I explained to my dad that I had decided to travel from Portland (where I live) to Houston for hurricane relief, his advice was to bring pepper spray among other things. My mother's advice? Bring paper panties.

So, why Houston? Why now? A good friend and I get together every now and then for happy hour and catch up. We were trying to schedule a HH when she mentioned she was planning on going to Houston for disaster relief. I've known her for years and always enjoyed her stories of helping out during Katrina, tornados, and other disasters. In the past, I wanted to do something like that, but had a job in the way, another excuse, and blah, blah, blah. So, when she mentioned it this time it was in passing and it didn't quite hit me for a few days. I looked around at what I was doing one night, and decided to send a text "I want to go with you." It was impulsive, but I figured I'd loft it out into the universe and see what happened. The next day I got a text back, "For real? You sure? Call me." By the time I got up and did my usual email checking etc. I got the news from her that she quit her job and was packing to go ASAP. Holy shit, I needed to make a decision. I told my girlfriend what I was thinking and she was supportive. So, I told my friend that I was "in" but needed a day or two to figure things out. We aimed to leave on Monday.

The next day I went shopping. Bought some waders, knee-high rubber boots, gloves, masks, and random supplies that spoke to me at the store. I had most of the gear I thought I'd need at home, and my GF had already bought me groceries for the drive. I was trying to pack light but was also preparing to go into a disaster zone - without knowing what to expect. I warned my friend that I had a lot of stuff, but by the time I packed my backpack and consolidated - it turned out to be not that much. Sunday night I couldn't sleep and was amped for the new frontier I was going into. I had no idea how long I'd be gone, and really no idea what I was getting myself into.

Monday morning my friend arrived at my house at 7 am and we loaded my stuff up into her Ford Focus. My luxury item was a collapsible camping chair. We ended up with plenty of room which was surprising for a small car. She was also packing pretty light. The cooler was filled to the brim with La Croix, my own fizzy water, and snack food for the road. We were on our way!

First stop would be Sacramento where I have family. It was interesting that we had never traveled together, and were completely comfortable the whole way. The fires in Oregon were pretty bad and the entire way from Portland into California was filled with smoky skies which were pretty surreal. After dropping off our stuff at my aunt's house in Sacramento we headed to an outdoor bar as I was trying to showcase some of the highlights of Sac-town. It gets such a bad rap but I really do have a place in my heart for that city. We knocked back probably more than we should have, but it was the first time we had to connect on what the hell we were doing and our feelings about it. It was a great night and really pumped us up for the unknowns ahead.
