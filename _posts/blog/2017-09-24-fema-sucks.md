With clean clothes, I was feeling good about the start of the new work week. We'd had time to become adjusted to our new base, and started to get a good routine going. Our meetings became part of our dinner so we had even more time for down time in the evenings. So far I'd seen quite a few volunteers come and go, but there were a few that came that were there for a longer period of time. We naturally gravitated to each other. Of course, with this many people (about 80) there was going to be some drama - but for the most part, we all got along pretty well. Afterall, anyone that was here was trying to help, which made any of the common discourtesies get brushed aside.

At this point, the number of major hurricanes was getting ridiculous and we all shared news tidbits as we found them throughout the days. Maria looked scary and we were all hoping it/she would go away. I still wanted to go down to the Islands or the Keys, but there were too many unknowns to make a solid plan.

With all that in mind, we were all still working every day - busting our butts. I started the day at the house I’d been on before where we did more “cleaning” and finished taking out floors. Our team lead was awesome and not sexist. It was a hot and sticky day but the house smelled much better after having a couple days of airing out. It really proved how important gutting a house was - the fact that we could go maskless in the same house that was super toxic a few days prior was telling.

The following day our house was an hour drive away. We meet quite a few Day volunteers (volunteers that didn't live with us and typically were only there for a day or so) at the house. The house was in a pretty bad state and the homeowners are still living there. It doesn't hit me how much of a bad state they're in until the day goes on. My team lead, Jill, is upset and trying to convince them that they need to find another place to stay so we can complete the house gut. It slowly dawns on me that we can't take out one of the bathrooms because they need to use it if they're living there.

We can't gut their bedroom. That mold will fester and grow everywhere we don't work on. There are curtains dividing the bedroom they're staying in and the rest of the house. Just imagine this for a second - we're doing demolition to the house but a corner of the house has sheets stapled to the walls surrounding their room. While I can completely understand the reasoning on their end, from our point of view it's just not something that's okay. Their box spring was completely damp still from the flood, even with fans blowing all over.

They have dogs. And they seem to be great pet owners. A couple of the dogs were sent off to relatives, a few remained in the backyard, but a couple had to be caged indoors. So, while we worked and made all kinds of racket we moved the cages around to lessen their trauma. But, I was also concerned about their health in the toxicity. It was just an unfortunate circumstance all around.

This was probably the first time that the trauma of the hurricane really hit me. This was the first house I had worked in where the inhabitants didn't have any other options but to stay where they were. They were confused by the system, didn't know how FEMA worked and didn't know that their current situation could harm them. I can't emphasize how absolutely frustrating this was for us, and I can't imagine how it must have felt for them.

The whole day was chaotic with so many Day Volunteers roaming about the house, and trying to keep them on task - and at the same time trying to do what was best for the folks living in the house. At the end of the day, we did our best to convince the owners to work with FEMA so they could stay somewhere else while we finished gutting.

The next day my team lead makes some headway with the owners. She has a frustrating call with FEMA who doesn't want anything to do with the situation. The owners need financial help so that they can stay someplace with their dogs. This proves to be complicated for a number of reasons. My anger with FEMA grows. I've heard some of the bad experiences homeowners had had with FEMA, but this was right in front of me. My team lead was told repeatedly that she couldn't be an advocate for these homeowners. You read that right. They had to do everything themselves. Yet, they didn't understand the system. I boiled. Jill, thankfully, was able to guide the homeowner to ask the right questions and get enough money for a few nights at a hotel so we could finish the house, and air it out to be even slightly habitable. This may not seem like an overwhelmingly "no to you" experience but I kept seeing it. Poor people were being shafted even if they had insurance. And, if they called FEMA it would be some ridiculous hoopla or wait. And I get that for government shit, sure, maybe it'll take a while. But, what I heard from this woman on the phone of FEMA to this homeowner I will never forget or forgive. Sure, maybe it was one disgusting twat, but it wasn't the first I'd heard of this type of abuse. Honestly this was minor from what I'd heard FEMA doing before - but this was my first time experiencing it. FEMA sucks. This is a systemic issue our country can't ignore. It will happen to your neighbor, and then you.

Honestly, I know this isn't a "just this time" type of problem. But, I also don't know how to bring it up to family and friends that we live in this seriously biased world and needs aggressive pushback if we ever want to see any change in the world.

Even with this frustration, we had a smaller and super effective team and we finished gutting the house the best we could.
