        <p>Back to work! So far I haven’t talked much about the dirty side of volunteering, mucking and gutting. I’d been in the South for a week and had only gotten dirty my first day. That was about to change.</p>

<p>So, what is mucking and gutting? Houses that have been flooded don’t just get water damage - they get muck filling their homes. And it can get pretty nasty. Mucking is clearing that debris out of the homes and neighborhoods. Most of the homes in Houston that we encounter have been filled with rising water through the walls and have already receded, so we deal with what’s leftover - houses covered with dirty water residue (including sewage). Some homes have been packed up and cleared by the owners, and others not so much. Ruined items become part of the muck and need to be tossed.</p>

<p>Gutting is basically demolition of anything structural that has been infected with mold, or will be. Mold travels fast, and the standard is to mark two feet above the visible mold line. (Moisture readers can also be used). We take out the drywall, insulation, baseboards, doors, cabinets, appliances, tubs and toilets, floors - basically anything below that line which can range from 2 feet to the ceiling. If the roof was damaged in the storm, we will also drop the ceiling. We save anything the homeowner wants and anything that can be salvaged. We then clean the house, which involves pulling all the exposed nails and removing all debris leftover from the demolition - to make the sanitization and rebuilding process easier and cheaper.</p>

<p><img src="/images/work-curb.jpg" alt="Curbside debris" /><em>Street with debris</em></p>

<p>For my first day back, we begin in a house that had already been started in the mucking/gutting phase. Debris on the curb needs to be within 15 feet in order for the trash pickup “claw” to reach. This house had debris much further than that, so we had to consolidate. I volunteered because it seemed straight forward and something I couldn’t screw up. It was actually more dangerous than I expected, trying to untangle boards and trim with nails everywhere.</p>

<p>It’s eye-opening to see such personal things discarded, and the owner is poking around to see if anything tossed out should be kept. There’s a lot of negotiation that is filled with private emotions. I imagine the thought process is of economic value, but also how sentimental things are - and saying goodbye to so many memories all at once. We finish around lunch time and the owner and her daughter come out to take pictures with us. They are super sweet and it feels pretty emotional when we leave.</p>

<p><img src="/images/work-debris.png" alt="House debris" /><em>House debris pile</em></p>

<p>The second half of the day is at a pretty dilapidated place that honestly should and maybe will get torn down. I felt a little awkward taking photos of the houses I’d been in so far, not knowing if it was disrespectful or not, so I only have a couple outside shots this week. The house was in pretty bad shape, and you couldn’t breathe without a face mask. You could smell the mold from the curb it was so intense. The entire house needed to be gutted.</p>

<p>The following day I return to the same house but with a different crew. The team leader decided to inform me that he’d be “looking out for me today”. He digs deeper by telling everyone he doesn’t think women should be in military combat. I respond with an eye roll so big I go blind. This “looking out for me” meant that I’d be lugging out debris all day, one wheelbarrow at a time, while the guys destroyed the floors. The piles of debris on the curb build into a mountain which makes it harder throughout the day. Friends of the homeowner come by and try to get the fish tank that was living on the front porch. I get to learn a little bit about the owner, how she is working full time throughout this, and how much the situation is taxing on her. I’m happy to see the fish make it out of there alive to another home.</p>

<p>The next day I’m assigned to a different team lead, crew, and strategy for the day. At the first house, no one is there. We did a few hours of work at the second stop, which was a condo. Then we drove to another house where they didn’t need us (the Mormons had beat us to the punch), and finally, we get to a house that we could work on for the afternoon. I got to take out cabinets which was super satisfying. Overall, the day felt inefficient and boring, but it was important to remember that the variables were all human - and coordinating this sort of relief was complicated. Earlier that week the staff decided Monday’s would be our one day off each week. So, it would be our day off tomorrow! Naturally, we all went out drinking to celebrate. A crew went down the street to a bar, and a few of us decided to brave a dive bar that was even closer. It was a garage that allowed smoking and they served bottled beers in cozies. It felt comforting.</p>

<p>I woke up late on our day off which was awesome. I finally got up and took a shower which had a little bit of warm water. Off to a good start! The three of us went to a laundromat and of course bumped into a few others from base doing the same. We all went to lunch and the two of us did a little bit of shopping at the dollar store. Back at base, I moved our cooler into the kitchen to store our drinks and leftovers. I filled the ice trays I just purchased in hopes that I could keep the cooler cool enough to act as our refrigerator (since we were forbidden to use the fridge for personal items). My friend wanted to stay and zone out on TV and it was too late for me to go exploring, so I ended up at a bar down the road with Wifi to work on this blog! Naturally, I added it to <a href="https://workfrom.co/clancys-public-house-richmond-133739">Workfrom</a>.</p>
