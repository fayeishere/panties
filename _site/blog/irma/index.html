        <p>During this time we’d been keeping an eye on Hurricane Irma and what that meant for the organization. We’d been given brief updates in the meetings, but mostly couldn’t do anything until we knew of the damage to come. Until then, it was business as usual for Houston relief efforts.</p>

<p>I left with my friends car on the morning of my third day (9/10), as I was scheduled for data entry in the office back at the other base. I assumed they were giving me a variety of tasks since I told them I’d be there for a month, and some of the short-term folks hated doing anything but working on the houses directly. I was personally fine with just helping wherever they needed me. The work wasn’t terribly exciting, but it was cool to see the inner operations while I shared the office tent. I got to see how the neighborhoods were mapped out, and understand the first steps of the relationship between the organization and the home owners.</p>

<p><img src="/images/irma-map.jpg" alt="Houston neighborhood map" /><em>Map of flooded Houston neighborhoods</em></p>

<p>One office volunteer was tasked with the “bat phone”. They answered incoming calls and listened to voicemails left by homeowners, and then transcribe their info on assessment paperwork. These papers would then be handed off to other volunteers within the week or so who would travel to the home and assess the house. Sometimes a neighborhood would be spotted without anyone reaching out, and team members would canvas directly. These assessors would gather important information about the state of the house, and personal information to help prioritize things on our end. All of this information would then be entered into a database - my task for the day. Eventually, the paperwork would make its way to a binder that a team leader would use when their team was tasked with working on that house.</p>

<p>After work, I was eating dinner when my friend walked in looking a bit flustered. She tells me that the director approached to ask her, her friend, and I (the 3 musketeers as they called us) to join the few in Florida that had gone to scout out the next base for the recent hurricane. We all agreed to go and we said our goodbyes during the meeting and went back to base to pack up a bit. We stopped along the way at a barbecue place and had one delicious beer. Drinking on base was forbidden and we’d been looking forward to cracking into one from our cooler all week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at our new base, the number of residential volunteers had doubled within the week. There was barely enough room for everyone to sleep on the floor, and we were expecting the numbers to rise. So, during the day the staff had filled the rooms with bunk beds with air mattresses. It was a nice change to sleeping on the floor.</p>

<p>At 10 pm the lights were turned out and we all settled in for sleep. The rooms we were in were separated by sturdy dividers that muffled some of the sounds. But not all! Someone next door started to snore louder than we thought humanly possible while some kind of new agey chime music played in the background. It was creepy, soothing, and hilarious at the same time. A woman in our room almost fell out of her bed, trying to get used to the top bunk. For an hour we all joked and giggled like we were at summer camp. We were a rowdy bunch of older ladies, probably louder than any other room.</p>

<p><img src="/images/irma-truck.jpg" alt="Relief trailer" /><em>Relief trailer ready for the road</em></p>

<p>The next day I got up at lights on at 6:30 am. I was feeling under the weather a little bit so I took a nice warm shower, and got my stuff together while we waited for some direction for our journey. We finally got on the road around 9:30 am and headed to Lousiana. We got to Denham and met up with the two folks that would take the RV/trailer full of supplies to Florida. As we caravanned through the south we saw a lot of disaster relief cars and trucks including power rigs heading to Florida as well. We made it to Pensacola in the evening and parked it in a Walmart parking lot. The generator in the RV wasn’t working so we planned to find someplace to fix it in the morning since it was keeping the perishables from perishing. We then drove to an Alum’s house where they were gracious and accommodating. They fed us a fantastic meal and set us up in different rooms to sleep. I got my own room in the grandkid’s space and felt giddy to have some space to myself.</p>

<p>The next day I slept in, expecting someone to wake me. My friend had started our laundry and our host folded them for us. They were so nice! I packed up and felt something was amiss. The driver of the RV trailer wanted to sit down with us for some news. He told us that instead of Florida, the team wanted to head to the US Virgin Islands as they needed more help at the moment. Which meant that the two with the RV would head to Atlanta and we could decide what to do with ourselves. We went back to the RV and loaded up the perishables in our cars and gave them to our hosts to distribute to some local relief organizations. The RV left and the three of us sat down and discussed our options. We looked into which cities seemed to be hit hardest that maybe we could help. One of us wanted to go back to Houston, my friend was leaning towards the Keys, and I thought maybe another city in FL would be flooded like Houston and should be a priority. We decided to get a hotel in Pensacola to take enough time to make a decision. After spending hours on the hotel wifi we concluded that it wasn’t smart to head into Florida without a team or tools. With half the state without power, we were concerned with the gas shortage and being more of a burden on resources than a help.</p>

<p>So, reluctantly we headed back to Houston the next morning and took a different highway back along the gulf and visit some of the places that these two had helped in the aftermath of Katrina. After lunch, we got back on the road and planned to arrive after rush hour in Houston. Everything was going well until we hit a complete stand-still on the freeway due to a car accident. With no shoulders and no turnoffs, we sat not moving for about an hour until we finally joined others in driving on the tiny grass along the side to get to a turnaround onto the other side of the freeway. My heart pumped looking down at the 10-foot deep trench that was inches from our tires but seemed our best bet. Later I learned that it was a 3 car fatality and 2 injured crash that caused a backup/shutdown of the highway for hours. We got a very bad hotel (the only available room in the area) and slept with the light to keep the roaches away. We got out of there before the sun was up.</p>

<p>September 14th. We arrived back at base pretty early which gave us time to find a good bunk situation and relax. We got situated and chatted with some of the staff to assure them that we had no hard feelings about the change of plans. My friend and I expressed interest in getting to the islands as soon as they got set up there and needed us. Even though I didn’t want to go “backward”, it felt good to be somewhere that we could get a routine going for a little while.</p>
